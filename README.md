Task 1:

Defined hierarchy of gemstones in accordance with their chemical structure / origin / physical properties

Base abstract class Gemstone is extended by:

In accordance with generally accepted classifications, only 4 stones are called "precious" and can be divided into:

1. Precious Diamond Stones - contains only diamonds (pure carbon minerals) with a specific cut type.
2. Precious Color Stones - contains other precious stones (Ruby, Emerald and Sapphire) with a complex chemical structure
and color determine impurities.

In accordance with generally accepted classifications, all others jewelery gemstones are "semiprecious", and 
can be divided into:

3. Semiprecious Mineral stones - stones of mineral origin - nature silicates with color determine impurities.
4. Semiprecious Organic stones - stones of nature origin - produced by animals or plants.

In addition, all precious stones are transparent, semiprecious stones may show additional transparency options -
TRANSLUCENT, SEMITRANSLUCENT, OPAQUE

The creation of single abstract classes "preciousStone" and "semipreciousStone" is beside the point because no unique
properties (fields) that can be identified to show the differences between these two classes.
